## Business logic vulnerabilities

Business logic vulnerabilities need manual intervention as No tool can detect these and they can vary from application to application and very hazardous. 
We have to understand application logic, application functionality, implementations, and business requirements. Whenever we intercept the request,
we have to manipulate specific parameters in the request or so to test for the business logic vulnerability


 ## Some common example of business logic:
 
 Manipulation in the product price in the request so we can purchase products in less amount during the online shopping.
 
 Manipulation in user-supplied input (too much quantity or â€“ve quantity) and not checked from the server-side.
 
 Manipulation in intended flow (2FA).
 
 ## 1. Manipulation in the product price in the request so we can purchase products in less amount during the online shopping.
 
 With Burp running, log in and attempt to buy the leather jacket. The order is rejected because you don't have enough store credit. 
 
 In Burp, go to "Proxy" > "HTTP history" and study the order process. Notice that when you add an item to your cart,
 the corresponding request contains a price parameter. Send the POST /cart request to Burp Repeater. 
 
 ## Request 
 
    POST /cart HTTP/1.1

    productId=1&redir=PRODUCT&quantity=1&price=133700
    
 ## Note That Show Price in request 
 
     productId=1&redir=PRODUCT&quantity=1&price=133700   
     
 So Change The Price and sand the request in server, like server is accept the request, here business logic vulnerabilities
 
 
 ## 2. High-level logic vulnerability
 
 Your card amount 100$ but you wante purchase 200$ product, buy 2 product first product price 50$ and secand product price 150$
 
 First Product nurp request sand burp repeter and  Observe that product quantity=1 so chnage the product guantity add -
 
 just like quantity=-2 and sand the request in server, accept the request, this is vulnerability 
 
 ## Request 
 
     POST /cart HTTP/1.1
